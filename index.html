    <h1>Café con Canela</h1>
    <h3>Our family loves to dirnk coffee with a hint of cinnamon; 'Café con Canela' is 'Coffee with Cinnamon' in Spanish, our family's first language.</h3>
    <p>Last year we added two fur babies to our family. They are as essential to our family as coffee with cinnamon is to our mornings. Hence why we named them...</p>

            <h2>Café</h2>
            <p>Café is a cute little pupper with adorable white spots in the middle of her chest and an almost unnoticable spot under her chin. Reminicent to when you first add creamer to coffee ... or foam on a latte... you get the idea :)</p>

            <h2>Canela</h2>
            <p>Canela is the adorable runt no one wanted from her litter! However, she is growing into an even colored coat and spicy attitude so naturally she is the cinnnmon... sometimes this mut reminds you of too much cinnamon in coffee :)</p>
